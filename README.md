textRamAlpha
============

I hacked this up at a hackathon (hackru 2012) and won "Han Shot First Solo" for best hack by a one man team.

I used Twilio with python to run this code and accept text messages and return reductions.

Note: This was written in one night and has bugs (Especially in division)

Input Format: All chars should be separated by spaces, operators are +-*/!()

`( 3 * x + 2 ) * ( 3 * x + 2 )`

`( x * y + 5 ) / y`

`15 ! / 12 !`
